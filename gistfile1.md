UT24 Buck Converter Test Board
Nicholas Burley, UTFR PCB Controllers Lead
The University of Toronto Formula SAE Racing Team (UTFR) is continually striving for innovation and optimal performance in the challenging world of formula racing. Our vehicle's electrical system is a testament to this dedication, ensuring efficient power management and distribution to various subsystems. They will be racing in Michigan, New Hampshire, Czech and Germany in 2024. 
The UT24 Buck Converter Test Board is the centerpiece of our endeavor to refine and optimize the power regulation of our car’s low voltage system. This test board aims to scrutinize the robustness and efficacy of the buck converter, which is poised to be a pivotal part of UTFR’s Rear Controller for our 2025 vehicle.

The primary role of the Buck Converter Test Board is to evaluate whether the converter can adequately power our car's low voltage system, which includes peripheral boards, our battery management system, multiple sensors and our Cascadia inverter. Boasting a higher amperage output and having a footprint considerably smaller than previous iterations, this buck converter promises enhanced performance without compromising space. Operating at a swift 1.455 Mhz, it is designed to efficiently regulate a 21-volt LV battery to a stable 12 volts, suitable for vehicular operations.
Altium Designer 2022, with its advanced tools and comprehensive interface, was instrumental in bringing the Buck Converter Test Board to life. The software's capabilities, from intricate schematics to detailed 3D visualization, facilitated a seamless design process. The ability to instantly integrate with JLCPCB's manufacturing standards ensured that our designs remained compliant and optimized for fabrication.
